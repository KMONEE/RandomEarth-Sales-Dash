# RandomEarth-Sales-Dash
 Tracking sales in luna and ust, and the count of transactions of Levana NFTs on Randomearth

2/1/22 - Right now the dashboards are pretty redundant. They all work but the dataframe building could probably be thrown into its own function that gets imported to each dashboard. This might be an update for later on but (as seen with the Talismans) whenever there is new NFT metadata it can throw everything off by changing the column names.
